          Cardiovascular classes
        </p>
        <p>
          Our boxing and kickboxing conditioning classes are 1-hour in length
          and BURN 800-1000 CALORIES PER CLASS! Get both, cardio and resistance
          training at the same time. The equipment requirements are elementary:
          heavy bags, gloves, your body, a timer and music. And you’ll get a
          workout that doesn’t miss a spot: a 1,000-calorie-an-hour cardio bomb
          and a superb all-body toner that builds shoulders and forearms and
          works legs, hips, abs, upper back, triceps, biceps and lats. Want to
          blast your deltoids? Try holding 16-ounce gloves at chin level for two
          rounds.
